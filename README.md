# Knowledge Base

#### Different Linux Distributions:

Differentiation between Redhat and Debian Linux:

* Redhat is commerical and Debian is non commerical.
* Redhat is more stable than Debian and hence is more popular options for `servers` than Debian
* Debian has around 38000 packages, whereas Redhat has only 3000 packages.
* Redhat's package manager `yum` is less mature than Debian's `apt`, so dependencies has to be resolved manually.
* Redhat updates are released during their major releases, which is generally every six months. Whereas, Debian releases are more continuous and frequent.
* Redhat uses `rpm` package manager and  Debian uses `dpkg` package manager.
* Variants of Redhat are `Fedora`, `CentOS` etc. Variants of Debian are `Ubuntu`, `Kali` etc.
* `Fedora` is like a testing lab for `Redhat`, so it contains the most recent/upto date packages. `CentOS` is a `RedHat` minus `Non-free packages`.
* `Ubuntu` is more suitable for beginners and not a good option for servers.

#### Shell Commands:

* Change shell ``chsh -s `which zsh` ``

#### Documentation on linux systems:

* `/usr/share/doc`

#### Units

* Use Ki, Mi, Gi for representing binary system. Use K, M, G for referring to decimal system to avoid ambiguity

#### Findings installed packages/files

* `which`
* `whereis`
* `locate`
